Park data for the Park Clinching project.
## Contributing
Want to map out some parks for Park Clinching? It's simple!
1. Begin by referencing the existing files in `/parks/` and make your own file with the same format.
2. Obtain coordinates for your park and add them to your new file. (I recommend [map-coordinates.net](https://www.mapcoordinates.net/))
3. When you're finished, open a pull request with your file for me to review and implement your changes!
